A naive implementation of bash, not complete but not not entirely useless, well, maybe really useless if you have bash
But aside the uselessness of this minishell, its entirely perfect for what it tries to accomplish, nothing wierd happens when you give it wierd arguments, its all expected

It contains 7 builtins: cd, echo, env, exit, export, pwd and unset

It also has simple redirections, you can redirect to files or to other fd's, but not from fd's to files, its always from STDIN, because yeah.. parsing that wasn't required
